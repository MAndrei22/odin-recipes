                <strong> Prep first.</strong> Start by preheating the oven and lining a large rimmed baking sheet with
                foil. You'll also want to set a wire rack on top of the baking sheet, and spry the wire rack with
                cooking spray to keep the wings from sticking.

                <strong>Season the wings and bake.</strong> You'll want to thoroughly pat the wings dry before seasoning
                them. Combine the baking powder, salt, garlic powder, black pepper, and paprika in a small bowl.
                Sprinkle this seasoning evenly over both the skin side and the flesh side of the wings. At this point,
                if time permits, line the wings on the baking sheet and place in the fridge for at least 45 minutes and
                up to 24 hours in advance. If you don't have the time to refrigerate, you can let the wings sit for
                10-15 minutes at room temperature or bake them immediately.

                <strong>Make garlic butter topping.</strong> When the wings are almost done, add the butter, garlic,
                salt, and parsley to a bowl and zap in the microwave for 30-60 seconds until the butter melts. Place the
                wings in a bowl, pour the garlic butter over the wings and toss to coat them evenly. Then, sprinkle with
                the parmesan and continue to toss until all the wings are evenly coated. Plate and serve immediately.
